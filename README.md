*Creating the technical conception for the OC Pizza application from project 4*

## :snake: Python App Development - Project 6 - OC Pizza !

Here is the [link](https://github.com/jonathanreveille/project6_OC.git) to the project

This project aims to create the technical conception for the OC Pizza system 
that was presented in project 4. We mainly use in this project UML diagram such
as the component diagram, the deployment diagram and the class diagram.

The project also asked the developer to create a prototype of the database
with MySQL. There are two files that you can use if you want that are 
placed into the sql_p6 folder of this repository. You may test it if you want.
In order to ease your testing, I recommend to use MySQLWorkBench.

There is also an physical data model that reflects the future database of
the OC Pizza system.
